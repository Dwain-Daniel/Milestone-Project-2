<h1>Milestone Project</h1>

This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far. I will be using this project to build a memory game. The idea is to flip the cards
to find matching pairs of images. 
Going forward I would like to include different difficulty options such as increased number of cards or a time limit.

<h3>UX</h3>

I want my site to be quite minimalistic and simple whilst remaining effective. I have used bright colours and an attractive font to show the fun nature of the game.
The game is quite self explanatory, with only one clickable button outside of the game board. This is the reset button, this initialises the reshuffling of cards and the game begins again. 

<h3>Features</h3>

The user will see a running total of the amount of moves made with each click. The timer will also start from the second click on the screen. 


<h3>Features left to implement</h3>

I would like to add a number of features going forward such as: <br>
<li>Increased difficulty levels</li>
<li>Customisable colour schemes</li>


<h3> Technologies Used </h3>

I have built my site using: 

<h3>CSS</h3>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS 
CSS allows me to edit and decorate my site in the way I see fit. It gives me the ability to edit my HTML and create classes.

<h3>HTML</h3> 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML 

<h3>JavaScript</h3> 
https://www.javascript.com/

<h3>Balsamiq</h3> 
https://balsamiq.com/# 
I used Balsamiq to help create my template and try design a quality game. <img src="assets/balsamiq/balsamiq.pdf">

<h3>Google Fonts</h3> 
https://fonts.google.com/
Google fonts were used to import the 'Gloria Hallelujah' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<h3>Testing</h3> 

I have tested my site thoroughly, all the links are working and take the user to the correct pages. 
The webpage will respond when used on smaller devices, the nav bar will shrink down into a drop down menu. 

I placed my site throught a CSS Validator which returned no errors <img src="assets/images/CSSValidator.JPG"> 

<h3>Deployment</h3>

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy the page using the following steps:

<li>I logged in to GitHub and located the GitHub Repository Milestone Project 1</li>
<li>I then clicked the Settings button on the menu.</li>
<li>I scrolled down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
<li>Under "Source" I selected "Master Branch".</li>
<li>The link was then published in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
